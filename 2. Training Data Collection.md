Training data in the form of points representing selected land cover classes of interest can be collected 
fully through ground-truthing the points by visiting the landscape of interest (often very expensive and 
impractical); fully through very high, high or moderate resolution satellite imagery (such as Google Earth
imagery or Sentinel imagery); or the most practical of options - a mix of both, often the contribution from 
satellite imagery outweighing the ground-truthed points, especially in large and rough-to-traverse landscapes.

There are various recommendations for the minimum number of samples for each class. Ideally, this should be
more than 50 samples per classes, well distributed through the landscape to be modelled. For this, hexagonal
grids can be overlaid on the surface of the study area with the sizes large enough so that there are only
around 30-40 hexagons covering the region (including partial hexagons). NOTE: This recommendation is based 
on a study area which was around 100 km x 150 km in size. You may want to change this number according to 
your study area. The hexagons can be created in the following manner.

Step 1: Open QGIS (version > 3.0) and start a new project

Step 2: Load the study area vector/polygon. It could be a custom drawn shapefile or some administrative 
boundary like district, state or country downloaded from somewhere.

Step 3: Go to 
```
Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer
```

Step 4: Select the study area polygon as the 'Input' and selected an approporate distance in m as 
the buffer so that the hexagons will cover the study area polygon entirely. Maybe something like 
10000 m (10 km or higher) might work for a relatively large area or if your polygon Coordinate 
Reference System (CRS) shows it in degrees, try  0.05 or more for relatively large areas.

This will create a buffer like this:

Step 5: Go to 
```
Vector > Research tools > Create Grid
```
![Step 1][4]

Step 6: Select the Hexagon grid type

![Step 2][5]

Step 7: 
```
Grid extent > Calculate from Layer > Select the vector of your study area amongst the objects shown
```

![Step 3][6]

Step 8: Play with the Horizontal spacing and Vertical spacing so as to get grids of preferred sizes.
For a study area nearly 100 x 150 km, 0.3 works. 

Step 9: Click on run (one can also click on the three dots under 'Grid' to name and save the output 
instead of creating a temporary layer).

Step 10: Select the newly created Grid. Then, click on 
```
Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip 
```
![Step 6][7]

Step 11: Change the 'Overlay Layer' to the vector layer/polygon of the study area and then Run.

![Step 7][8]

In Google Earth Pro (desktop) or Google Earth (online), collection of training data can be done by 
zooming into different regions of the hexagons (ideally well spaced between the points) and taking 
6 (or a number of your choice) points per hexagons for each class. To find out the number of points 
to be taken for the partial hexagons, first calculate the area of each of the hexagons in QGIS. The
number of classes can be selected based on your study objectives. It can be broad classes like 
grasslands or even subsets of such classes like montane grasslands and alluvial grasslands. More 
the number of classes, the higher complexity in classification as well as higher likelihood of 
misclassification. Too few classes can also result in misclassification. 

Step 12: For this, select the layer containing the polygons in the Layers panel. Then right 
click, and click on Properties. Then open 'Manage Fields' on the left pane

![enter image description here][9]

Step 13: Then, click the Field Calculator (abacus icon) button in the Fields option under 
Layer Properties. It is the fourth button on the horizontal top left of the below screenshot. Then 
```
'Create a new field' > Add 'Area' as 'Output Field name' > Write "$area" under 'Expression' > click 'OK'
```
This calculates the area of each polygon in the vector.

![enter image description here][10]

Step 14: Then Click on 'Apply'

Step 15: Then select the layer again > Save Layer Edits 

![enter image description here][11]

Then Uncheck 'Toggle Edits' if needed

![enter image description here][12]

Step 16: You can view the column with the calculated area by checking the Attribute Table - 
right click on layer > Open Attribute Table

![enter image description here][13]

See the column titled 'Area' on the right. Clicking on any row will highlight the particular
hexagon (or partial hexagon) on the map.

![enter image description here][14]

Step 17: Now repeat the same steps to create a new column "No. of points" in the attribute 
table by using the following expression in the Field Calculator for the same layer:

    round(round($area/840000000,2)*6) 
    
where the area of a normal hexagon is 840000000 (Replace this number in the expression with 
the area that you have found for your regular hexagons. For finding the area of a regular 
hexagon, you can just look at the biggest numbers in the table and select the first digits, 
which will be the same for those large numbers (84 in this case, and then add trailing zeroes
to make it the same number of digits as those numbers). This equation will give the number of
points per class to be ground-truthed per hexagon/cell. You can use this to take the appropriate 
number of points for the partial hexagons (assuming that you want to use 6 points per hexagons). 

Step 18: The following Google Earth Engine script can be used to download (into Google Drive)
cloud-optimised Sentinel imagery between the dates 1st January 2024 and 31st December 2024 after some cloud-masking.

```
/**
 * Function to mask clouds using the Sentinel-2 QA band
 * @param {ee.Image} image Sentinel-2 image
 * @return {ee.Image} cloud masked Sentinel-2 image
 */
function maskS2clouds(image) {
  var qa = image.select('QA60');

  // Bits 10 and 11 are clouds and cirrus, respectively.
  var cloudBitMask = 1 << 10;
  var cirrusBitMask = 1 << 11;

  // Both flags should be set to zero, indicating clear conditions.
  var mask = qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudBitMask).eq(0)
      .and(qa.bitwiseAnd(cirrusBitMask).eq(0));

  return image.updateMask(mask).divide(10000);
}

// Import the study area
var studyarea = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-paulpop/assets/siang");
Map.centerObject(studyarea, 8);

//Map.addLayer(points);

var dataset = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED')
                  .filterDate('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
                  // Pre-filter to get less cloudy granules (10%).
                  .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE',10))
                  .map(maskS2clouds)
                  .filter(ee.Filter.bounds(studyarea));
                  //.median();
                  
// Select specific bands
var selected_bands = dataset.select(['B2', 'B3', 'B4']);

// Get the median image of the selected bands
var median_image = selected_bands.median();

var visualization = {
  min: 0.0,
  max: 0.3,
  bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'],
};

Map.addLayer(dataset, visualization, 'RGB');

// Export the result
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: median_image,
  description: 'Sentinel_data_2024',
  folder: 'GEE image downloads',
  region: studyarea.geometry(),
  scale: 10,
  maxPixels: 1e13,
  formatOptions: {
    cloudOptimized: true
  }
});


```
Step 19: Use the downloaded imagery to view for training data collection. The SendToGE Plug 
can be used to click on a point to move to the same place in Google Earth Pro imagery so that
all the training data collection can occur in one location. This might not work for Linux as 
it has compatibility issues with the Send2GE plugin. so, the Sentinel imagery can directly 
be loaded in Google Earth Pro.
