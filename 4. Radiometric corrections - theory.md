There many such radiometric corrections, but they are largely the atmospheric and topographic corrections.

**Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)**

The nadir of a satellite refers to the point on the Earth's surface that is directly beneath the satellite at any given moment. Satellites are not always pointing directly at the nadir. For example, Landsat acquire images at view angles ±7.5° from nadir that results in small directional effects in the surface reflectance (Roy et al, 2016). This results in BRDF errors.

Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is defined as the ratio of reflected radiance in a given outgoing direction to the irradiance in the incoming direction, describing the reflection properties of a surface at different viewing and incident angles (Encyclopedia of Modern Optics, 2018).

**Adjacency effect**
